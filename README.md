# rock_paper_scissors

Friday August 5th:
Step 1:

Create plan and outline of the structure of the web page.
Three image buttons rock paper scissors for user input

Step 2:

Write js script (no idea how to do this yet) - I am learning Javascript from scratch.

Current plan:
Start with script for computer input for options
Then user input

Okay - so this has been a huge learning curve.
I have rewritten my code numerous times and I have finally been
able to have the game play on button click. It runs the game and tells
the user if they win against the computer through alert.

Btw - my steps above didn't work, I had to create script that
consol.log'd the results for both user and computer seperately before
combining the two to play it on the consol with an alert. THEN I was able
to figure out how to use button.id and listeners to give the buttons functionality for the user.

This has been a really great learning experience, and when I finally got the game
to run on button click with the alert of who wins. I spontaniously laughed with joy.

Next step:

figure out how to play five rounds and have a counter of wins on the page.
